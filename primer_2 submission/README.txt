Memos 1 works perfectly including decimal number printous.

Memos2 drove us insane, as neither of us could figure out why GNU refernce code or OSDEV sample code could not work. We can clear screen and print to it from the asm file but jumping or calling c functions is not working for some reason. Craig concurs.
